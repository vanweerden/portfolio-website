# Portfolio Website
This is a single-page website where I can showcase my web development projects. However, it is itself one of my main projects. My goal is to make it the best representation of myself as a developer, both in style and functionality. It has been coded from the ground up with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a sprinkle of PHP for flavor.
