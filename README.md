# Portfolio Website

This is a single-page website where I can showcase my web development projects. However, it is more than that: this webpage is itself one of my main projects. My goal is to make it the best representation of myself as a developer, both in style and functionality. It has been built from the ground up with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Features
### HTML & CSS
- Clear, concise, and well-documented code
- Use of media queries for responsive design
- Semantic and accessible HTML
- Maintainable CSS: use of variables for colors to allow for easy color scheme tweaks
- Hover effects in project section and in welcome section (easter egg!!)

### JavaScript
- Contact form that utilises JavaScript form validation (and PHP on the server side)
- Custom-built drop-down menu for smaller screens
- Night/dark mode switch
